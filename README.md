# beeminderjs
NodeJS wrapper for Beeminder API. Designed for use within NodeJS apps, although at some point I'll probably make it so that you can run it as a script too

    npm install beeminder

Created for integration with [Complice](https://complice.co), a productivity app that's more *qualified*-self than quantified-self.

## Currently

- getUser
- getGoal
- getDatapoint
- createDatapoint

## todo

- implement other endpoints
- make it so it can be used from command-line.
